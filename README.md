# DGTTest
Hello, this is my first WPF project. 
I tried to use the MVVM structure here.

# About functionality:
On first page u can see list of 10 top currencies, u can change this number by typing integer to the TextBox on the right and pressing button Refresh.
Also u can see the TextBox Search. As u can understand by the name, this TextBox gives u option to do smart search in this list.

Next u can double-click on one of the currencies and go another page with detailed info about it. (These procedure will take some time cause there a lot of markets)
So on this page will be detailed info.

Thats all for now. Thanks 😀👍
